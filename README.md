## Hi there!

I'm Naut van der Winden, a software development student from the Netherlands. But you'll probably know me as "ScottishPuffin" or "SirMisterMactavish". I enjoy programming, gaming and hiking. I'm also rather interested in old (60's - 80's) music. I too like late soviet music (and early russian) from bands like "Альянс" and "Кино".
Since I was young, I've had an interest in programming and computers in general. For the last few years, I've been certain that I want to become a software developer (preferably something to do with game development).

Currently, I can confidently use python, HTML, css and Javascript to build personal projects. I hope to learn Java and C# during my attendance of Secondary Vocational Education.
